<h3>Talk abstracts</h3>
<ul><h4>Lightning Talk | The 4 C’s of Training from the back of the room</h4>
    <p>This Lightning talk gives a primer on Sharon Bowman’s “Training from the back of the room,” a training method
        that’s more like learning; that is, training in a way that maximizes the utility, engagement, and effectiveness
        of teaching a given subject.
    </p></ul>

<ul><h4>Stop, Collaborate & Listen</h4>
    <p>Remember back to the best work you’ve ever done with a team of people. There was room for creativity, open &
        free-wheeling dialogue, a sense of excitement to dig into the work. Why did it go so well? Because the
        foundations were in place to make working in concert possible.
    </p>
    <p>Teams accomplish more than individuals. We need to maximize that work using more interesting, creative and most
        importantly effective solutions to collaborating. Join for a deep dive on how and when to apply a host of proven
        and novel techniques.</p></ul>

<ul><h4>Bringing Ingenuity Back to Engineering</h4>
    <p>Developers, do you have innovative ideas that go unheard? Product Owners, does it feel like the solutions you
        deliver lack ingenuity? We have agile stories, empowered teams, and the latest in technology--yet we all know we
        could be doing better. We just don’t know how to unleash the fury and allow teams to capitalize on their own
        ideas. Allow us to introduce you to ShipIt Days.
    </p>
    <p>ShipIt Days is a concept adopted from Atlassian, typically a 24-hour event in which employees can form small
        teams to try a new technology, a different way of working, or a novel approach to a business problem. They then
        demo what they shipped, sometimes with a business case and working prototype.
    </p>
    <p>We have 5+ years of experience implementing ShipIt days on different teams, projects, and companies. We will
        break down the What, How, and Why of ShipIt Days and give the audience a way to start capitalizing on the
        talented teams they already have. We’ll also touch on the other (numerous) benefits of ShipIt Days to the
        overarching goal of sustainable development including passion, enthusiasm, motivation, and a time to catch our
        breath from the daily grind of sprint work.

<ul><h4>Something's Rotten in the State of Quality</h4>
    <p>Developers, do you really trust QAs when they find a “bug"? QA folks, do you believe that developers have tested
        their work before they hand it over? You may identify with this atmosphere of contention surrounding QA. But
        there’s one underlying question for every team: are we building a quality product?
    </p>
    <p>The definition of quality should go beyond a list of test cases executed against requirements. From the father of
        the quality revolution, Edward Deming, to the work of Martin Fowler and Mike Cohn, we’ll lay a theoretical
        groundwork for what quality is, then we will showcase these definitions with examples. We’ll end with specific
        activities along the software development life cycle that actually help assure quality. You’ll take away what it
        truly means to assure quality as well as ways to start putting it into practice.
    </p>
    <p>If you’re a developer, project manager, product owner, BA, or QA tester, this talk is for you.

<ul><h4>Stop the Iteration Bait and Switch</h4>
    <p>Have you ever worked on an agile project where you were pressured to get something out the door? Maybe you were
        told “it doesn’t have to be perfect,” “this is agile,” or “we will iterate on it.” The next thing you know you
        have a handful of half-baked features shipped, mountains of features ahead of you, and nowhere in sight is that
        promised opportunity to iterate.
    </p>
    <p>Agile has the good intentions of encouraging iterative and incremental development but how to accomplish that can
        feel far from intuitive. Without understood practices, iteration doesn’t occur and the product ends up shipping
        as is. In this talk a pragmatic duo will breakdown what it truly means to build a product iteratively and
        incrementally. We will share how we have approached these problems by deconstructing a product roadmap with you
        and showcasing real examples from our experiences. Join us and learn how you can start iterating on your
        projects today.
    </p>
    <p>This session is targeted not only to product owners and management, but also developers. It takes the engineers
        to capitalize on these approaches.
