Hey Kathy, I recently started working as a Data Analyst and I was wondering what resources you would recommI heard the
news, congratulations!!! You are a part of Decision Science, right?

You raise a big question actually, service teams using scrum effectively / service teams integrating into the bigger
picture
I like this article :
https://www.loginconsultants.com/en/news/tips-tricks/item/7-lessons-i-ve-learned-using-scrum-for-infrastructure-projects
where I would call out specifically everything but for #1.
2. DS (from what I know) does a good job of trying to only bite off specific chunks
3. having all the required skills on the team - does DS have enough DE support? Or will DA’s continue to take on DE
skills? Consider this question very carefully.
4. having necessary access is probably less of a problem, I would guess, though I know there are big env’t struggles.
Maybe DS (DEs) could find ways to make more room to tackle the root issues and give ‘keys to the kingdom’ to other teams
5. Do you have a Definition of Ready with your team?
6. Are the conditions of satisfaction appropriate? I have heard that there are some misses, that what is being delivered
does not precisely meet the stakeholder need. This is huge to spend more time on doing discovery to understand the needs
7. …and 7 can help with that. Are your stakeholders available enough? Are they understanding their own needs? If not,
how can DS help them understand, maybe showing not telling.
3 & 4 in this article are highly relevant to your question too:

I really like how this one lays out a vision:

<h1>Scrum for Data Analyst Team</h1>

<p>Subtitle note</p>

<h2>Square 1: Learn about the Scrum Master role</h2>

<h2>Understand More About How Work Gets Done</h2>

<p>Think outside the box! Consider signing up for an Improv (Improvisational theatre) class. Volunteer to lead a project
    outside of work, as a board member or Meetup group, or at a community group. Think about the Scrum Master role and
    how these experiences give you an opportunity to practice your skills (and learn from failure).</p>
