<ul><h3>Working Agreements Toolkit</h3>
    <p><i>Working agreements (AKA team norms) are guidelines developed by a team for how they will work together to
        achieve their objectives. Working agreements describe positive behaviors that, although basic, can vary from
        group to group or be forgotten in the moment. For example, an agreement might be 'We all agree to participate
        fully.'</i><br><br>
        Agreements are one of the ways a team 'sharpens the saw.' The purpose of setting up team norms is to establish a
        one unifying team culture, and it is something to refer back when things get rocky.<br><br>
        See my <a href="/resources/working-agreements">Working Agreements page</a>.</p><BR>
</ul>

<ul><h3>Managing Work: Methods</h3>
    <p>I love thinking in abstract terms about different methods of managing work and when they might be appropriate.
        See my <a href="/resources/managing-work">Managing Work page</a> for more.</p><BR>
</ul>

<ul><h3>How to start the journey to become a (great) Scrum Master</h3>
    <p>I get this question once in a while and wrote up how I would advise someone investigating the role: <a
            href="/resources/become-scrum-master">Become a Scrum Master.</a></p><BR>
</ul>

<ul><h3>Spark a quality revolution on your team</h3>
    <p>In order to set your team up for collective ownership you need to <a href="/resources/conversation-on-quality">form
        a shared vision for quality.</a> In having a conversation, you take the reins and decide as a team what quality
        looks like on your team. You can then go forward with confidence in owning the execution of that vision.</p><BR>
</ul>

<ul><h3>Book Recommendations</h3>
    <p>A mind map of book recommendations from conferences, Meetups, and interactions with curious individuals. <a
