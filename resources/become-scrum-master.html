<h1>How to start the journey to become a (great) Scrum Master</h1>
<p>Two notes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>This <em>title</em> is long for a reason. Becoming a great Scrum Master is a journey that requires investment of
        time, energy, and effort.
    </li>
    <li>This <em>guide</em> is targeted at the Scrum Master role in product development. (It is applicable to Scrum
        Master roles outside of that space as well: use the Technical Literacy section to think about how it would apply
        to your chosen industry.)
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Square 1: Learn about the Scrum Master role</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Look up some example job resumes to learn the lingo of how different organizations talk about what the Scrum
        Master role is.
    </li>
    <li>Do an informational interview with a couple of Scrum Masters to learn about their day-to-day and their own
        journey to becoming a Scrum Master.
    </li>
    <li>Listen to 1-2 episodes of the <a href="https://scrum-master-toolbox.org">Scrum Master Toolbox Podcast</a> for a
        sneak peek into the SM world.
    </li>
</ul>

        Work in Half the Time</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Understand More About How Work Gets Done</h2>
<p>Scrum is just one framework among many for building great software in an agile manner. Along with a familiarity of
    Scrum, I would highly recommend that you keep your eyes open to learn about Lean, Kanban, Modern Agile, XP, and
    waterfall development.</p>
<p>For a comparison and some history, start with this article <a
        href="https://realtimeboard.com/blog/choose-between-agile-lean-scrum-kanban/">How to choose between Agile and
    Lean, Scrum and Kanban &mdash; which methodology is the best?</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Confidence &amp; Leadership</h2>
<p>I have interviewed for Scrum Master positions across the country, and I want to start with an important point of
    perspective. A company thinking about hiring you is looking for someone they can entrust with large areas of
    responsibility: the implementation of their most important projects and the happiness and success of their most
    valuable asset (their people). Thus to apply for a Scrum Master position, you must demonstrate a level of leadership
    that qualifies you to be entrusted with important responsibilities as these.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Leadership is a broad term. What does it look like? Let's break it down:</p>
<h4>Know what you need to do</h4>
<p>First, this is a "<em>figure out where the problems are and then fix them"</em> kind of job. No one will be handing
    you a task list (or sometimes even a project list) to deliver on. You will need to come into a new team and figure
    out how the team (as a system) works. You will need to figure out the people and how they work together. And then
    every day from that point, you will need to figure out the most impactful thing you should be working on not just
    for the day but looking ahead at the end of the sprint, the next sprint, and way beyond that.</p>
<h4>Be a servant leader</h4>
<p>Besides not having a clear charter, you will also need to figure out how to make everyone else around you the most
    successful and best versions of themselves. Your role will be overhead, also known as a deadweight on the team. You
    need to understand why you fill the role you do so that you are confident serving instead of contributing. Check out
    this Mike Cohn article for <a
            href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/eight-tips-to-become-the-scrum-master-your-team-needs">8
        Tips to Being the Scrum Master Your Team Needs</a>.</p>
<h4>Speak to your ideas</h4>
<p>Be able to speak in front of people. Know why the tools and techniques work so that you can support the application
    of the framework very well.</p>
<h2>Technical Literacy</h2>
<p>You need an understanding of the domain you're working in. That might not mean you are contributing thousands of
    lines of code to your team's project; that does mean you should work to be comfortable understanding the product,
    the technology, and the abstractions that underly both of them.</p>
<p>One resource I&rsquo;d definitely mention is <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans' blog</a>. She documents her path
    into Computer Science from the very start, written in a way that teaches as she learns.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also highly recommend the power of podcasts for learning the lingo and abstractions that might be the level
    of familiarity you&rsquo;re looking for. Developer on Fire, InfoQ (multiple good ones), and Software Engineering
    Daily are all excellent.</p>
<p>Business Analysis tools / methods are highly useful as well. Knowledge of good analysis practices such as
    diagramming, glossaries, and requirements gathering will help in breaking down problems. Learn a programming
    language like SQL or PostgreSQL to be able to understand your products and metrics.</p>
<h2>Collaboration + Soft Skills</h2>
<p>There are some other tools you will need to add to your toolbelt.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Facilitation of scrum events and beyond</li>
    <li>Crucial conversations</li>
    <li>Coaching</li>
    <li>Team formation</li>
    <li>Reflection + retrospection</li>
    <li>Empowerment, like leader-leader culture</li>
    <li>Drive & motivation (read the book by Daniel Pink)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Scrum Master Reading List</h2>
<p>Here are some very good lists from which to pull reading materials. Signing up to be a Scrum Master? Expect to keep
    learning constantly. There is so much to synthesize and understand.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://jordanjob.me/scrum-master-reading-list/">Jordan Job's Scrum Master Reading list</a> (with short
        explanation)
    </li>
    <li>Great content on Empiricism and Scrum: <a href="https://www.scrum.org/pathway/scrum-master">Scrum Master
        Learning Path</a></li>
    <li>Pavlichencko's <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/30-books-scrum-masters">list of 30 books</a> split
        out by learning area
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Get Experience Where You Can</h2>
<p>Think outside the box! Consider signing up for an Improv (Improvisational theatre) class. Volunteer to lead a project
    outside of work, as a board member or Meetup group, or at a community group. Think about the Scrum Master role and
    how these experiences give you an opportunity to practice your skills (and learn from failure).</p>
