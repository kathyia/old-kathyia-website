<h1>Spark a quality revolution on your team</h1>

<p>I am writing you with another challenge. <a
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-your-qas-fault-why-we-continue-fail-building-high-andersen-csm/">The
    previous article</a> was intended to shift your perspective on who owns quality on your team. You now know that
    quality is everyone’s responsibility, and you’re wondering how to achieve that in practice.
</p>
<p>As @Nicholas Tuck and I put forward in our talk, Something’s Rotten in the State of Quality, the first step is to
    host a conversation with your team. In order to set your team up for collective ownership you need to form a shared
    vision for quality. In having a conversation, you take the reins and decide as a team what quality looks like on
    your team. You can then go forward with confidence in owning the execution of that vision.
</p>
<p>Thus, the first thing to do is have a deliberate conversation around quality specific to your projects and your
    users. For many of us this will be the first intentional, honest conversation we’ve had about quality. With that in
    mind, I want to set you up for success by offering a play-by-play for a conversation on quality.
</p>

<h2>The 5 plays for a great conversation on Quality</h2>
<h3>One: Schedule the conversation</h3>
<p>Schedule a meeting with the team to talk about quality. Don’t leave out the Product Owner, the key release team
    member, the designer--you need the entire scrum team there who will deliver the product. Don’t worry about timing,
    even if you are in the middle of a project, there is still time to change how things are done and have an impact on
    your quality outcomes.
</p>
<p>For the first meeting, schedule at least an hour to allow enough time for group discussion and consensus. Your first
    conversation might cover more ground to get everyone on the same page about quality. After that, this conversation
    could be part of every project kickoff. It probably should happen every few months.
</p>

<h3>Two: Define “quality”</h3>
<p>Break down your definition of quality as fitness for use. Take a stab at all the different aspects of quality that
    make the product fit for your specific users. Identify the importance of each aspect and have a real conversation
    about which ones actually represent or capture that feeling of quality in your particular context at hand.</p><img
        src="/images/Define-quality" width=15%>
<h4>Activity: Quality Aspects</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Provide a list of system quality attributes to all attendees. (Link)
    <li>Each person will work independently to choose the aspects of quality
        <ul>
            <li>Circle the aspects that they think apply in the project context.
            <li>Cross out the ones that don’t.
            <li>Add a “?” next to the ones they are unsure of.
        </ul>
    <li>Leave an empty part of the page indicating attributes you have yet to discover that make your products fit for
        use.
    <li>Collect the votes and see where the themes emerge.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Three: Reinforce team ownership</h3>
<p>At this point in the conversation, cover some bases on quality by highlighting the difference between Quality Control
    and Quality Assurance. You can use the comparison chart as found on Diffen.com. There may still be a place for
    quality control activities in your team’s approach to quality; however, quality control is only one technique of
    assuring that you are doing the best job of building products and features that fit the needs of your users.</p>
<img src="/images/Reinforce-team-ownership" width=15%>
<p>“If you really want to scale your development process you'll need the real QA and you won't want to confuse it with
    QC.”</p>
<p>-- Hillel Glazer</p>

<p>Armed with this information, ask the team to brainstorm the processes that will affect the quality being produced.
    Does the team have the information, skills, and resources they need to achieve the quality outcome? This could
    include the ability to improve development and test processes. This could include putting in place a way to measure
    fitness for use. Show that the entire team is responsible for the overall picture of quality. The goal is to give
    the reins to the entire team to own the process and thus the quality outcomes.</p>


<h3>Four: Identify ‘Hats of Assuring Quality’ on your team</h3>
<p>The “Hats of Assuring Quality” is a mental model illustrating how different team members will put on different hats
    during the course of developing a product. For example, at the onset of a new project, the product owner and the
    designer might wear the hat of “Building the Right Product,” where they seek to do everything they can to ensure
    they understand the user needs and can assure quality in that the features and product will meet the fitness for use
    definition. Your team’s task in this play is to identify the hats needed to reach your defined level of quality.</p>

<p>Some Example “Hats” of Assuring Quality</p>
<p>Right Product | Implementation | Efficiency | Preventing Defects | Quality Control</p>

<p>You can start by talking about who’s really good at wearing certain hats. This can be a great time to acknowledge
    strengths. Next, turn the conversation to highlighting who has tried and failed to wear certain hats and to learn
    from them as a team (#FailingForward). As you do this, look beyond current roles and responsibilities. Ask who has
    always wanted to wear Hat XYZ and discuss how they can try it on for the first time. Identify ways that the team
    wants to work together to accomplish these goals, and don’t leave a team member feeling that they have to go it
    alone. Engaging in this conversation further cements whole-team ownership of quality.</p>

<h3>Five: Add quality to the Definition of Done</h3>
<p>From ScrumInc.com: “The Definition of Done ensures everyone on the Team knows exactly what is expected of everything
    the Team delivers. It ensures transparency and quality fit for the purpose of the product and organization.” Just as
    understanding what Done means on a story by story basis, understanding what quality means for your project and your
    users frames the approach your team needs to take to achieve it.</p>

<p>So for the last part of this conversation on quality, synthesize your team’s conversation on quality and add it to
    your Definition of Done. Make that vision for quality part of how you implement the product and part of your quality
    control checks: what do you build and how will you check it. Use it to guide which activities your team will employ
    to assure the quality of the product being produced, such as what do you need to learn. Allow it to help your team
    eliminate waste and avoid rework. And bringing us full circle to the first play, keep it visible and revisit it as
    necessary.</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>To assure quality you need to build a team around people that can fulfill the roles needed to produce a fit-for-use
    application. You need to think of the whole system of production, the team, not the bits and pieces of test cases
    and regression steps. You need to empower the team to work well together, collaborate with users, facilitate
    feedback, understand problems, brainstorm solutions, implement, and iterate. And once you have built that team, you
    must then allow them, challenge them, and empower them to own quality.</p>

<p>Apply these concepts and host your own conversation. Let us know how it goes and I’d love to see you at our talk,
    Something's Rotten in the State of Quality, at Connectaha on March 8, 2019.</p>
