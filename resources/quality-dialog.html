<h1>Spark a quality revolution on your team</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-your-qas-fault-why-we-continue-fail-building-high-andersen-csm/">The
    previous article</a> in this series<sup>1</sup> was intended to shift your perspective on who owns quality. You know
    that quality is everyone's responsibility, and you are wondering how to achieve that in practice.
</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.thesoftwaregardener.com/presentations/somethings-rotten-in-the-state-of-quality/">Nicholas
    Tuck</a> and I put forward in our talk, the first step is to host a team conversation. The goal of this conversation<sup>2</sup>
    is to set your team up for collective ownership. You need a dialog around quality specific to your projects and your
    users. You get to decide on a shared vision for quality as a team.
</p>
<p>For many of us this will be the first intentional, honest conversation we have had about quality. With that in mind,
    I want to set you up for success by offering a play-by-play for a first conversation on quality.
</p>

<BR>

<h2>The 5 plays for a great conversation on Quality</h2>
<h3>One: Schedule the conversation</h3>
<p>Schedule a meeting with the team to talk about quality. Do not leave out the Product Owner, the key release team
    member, the designer--you need the entire scrum team there (those responsible for delivering the product). Choose a
    facilitator and empower them with the information they need to be successful.
</p>
<p>Do not worry so much about timing. Even if you are in the middle of a project, there is still time to change how
    things are done and have an impact on your quality outcomes.
</p>
<p>For the first meeting, schedule at least an hour to allow enough time for group discussion and consensus. Your first
    conversation might cover more ground to get everyone on the same page about quality. After that, this conversation
    could be part of every project kickoff. It probably should happen every few months. The goal is to start the
    dialog<sup>3</sup> in motion.
</p>

<h3>Two: Define "quality" together</h3>
<p>Break down your definition of quality. Start with laying the foundation, where <i>quality = fitness for use by the
    users who will actually use it</i>. Then, take a stab at deciding how the different aspects of quality make the
    product fit for your circumstances--or how they are not relevant. Identify the importance of each aspect and have a
    real conversation about which ones actually capture that feeling of quality for your users.
</p>
<h4>Activity: Quality Aspects</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Provide a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes">list of system quality
        attributes</a> to all attendees.
        <ul>
            <li>Examples include: resiliency, simplicity, maintainability, learnability.</li>
            <li>Leave an empty part of the page indicating attributes you have yet to discover that make your products
                fit for use.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <li>Each person will work then independently to choose the aspects of quality. Instructions:
        <ul>
            <li>Circle the aspects that they think apply in the project context.
            <li>Cross out the ones that do not.
            <li>Add a "?" next to the ones they are unsure of.
        </ul>
    <li>Collect the votes and see what themes emerge.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Three: Reinforce team ownership</h3>
<p>At this point in the conversation, brief the team on the difference between Quality Control and Quality Assurance.
    You can use the <a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Quality_Assurance_vs_Quality_Control">comparison chart as
        found on Diffen.com.</a> There may still be a place for quality control activities in your teamâ€™s approach to
    quality; however, quality control is only one technique of assuring that you are doing the best job of building
    products and features that fit the needs of your users.
</p>
<div class="quote">
    <p><i>"If you really want to scale your development process you'll need the real QA and you won't want to confuse it
        with QC."
        <br>-- Hillel Glazer</i>
    </p>
</div>

<p>Armed with this information, ask the team to brainstorm the processes that will affect the quality being produced.
    Does the team have the information, skills, and resources they need to achieve the quality outcome? This could
    include the ability to improve development and test processes. This could include putting in place a way to measure
    fitness for use. Show that the entire team is responsible for the overall picture of quality. Give the reins to the
    entire team to own the process and thus the quality outcomes.</p>


<h3>Four: Identify "Hats of Assuring Quality" on your team</h3>
<p>
    Building on the quality attributes and quality assurance processes the team identified, the next step is to talk
    about putting them into practice. Your team's task in this play is to identify the hats needed to reach your defined
    level of quality. The "Hats of Assuring Quality" is a mental model illustrating how different team members will put
    on different quality hats during the course of developing a product.
</p>
<p>
    For example, at the onset of a new project, the product owner and the designer might wear the hat of "Building the
    Right Product." With this hat they seek to do everything they can to ensure an understanding of the user needs such
    that the features and product vision will meet the fitness for use definition.
</p>

<table id="t01">
    <tr>
        <th>Some Example "Hats" of Assuring Quality</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Right Product | Implementation | Efficiency | Preventing Defects | Quality Control</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p> You can start by talking about who is really good at wearing certain hats. This can be a great time to acknowledge
    strengths. Next, turn the conversation to highlighting who has tried and failed to wear certain hats and to learn
    from them as a team (#FailingForward).</p>
<p>As you do this, look beyond current roles and responsibilities. Ask who has always wanted to wear Hat XYZ and discuss
    how they can try it on for the first time. Identify ways that the team wants to work together to accomplish these
    goals, and do not leave a team member feeling that they have to go it alone. Engaging in this conversation further
    cements whole-team ownership of quality.</p>

<h3>Five: Add quality to the Definition of Done</h3>
<p>From <a href="https://www.scruminc.com/definition-of-done/">ScrumInc.com:</a> <i>"The Definition of Done ensures
    everyone on the Team knows exactly what is expected of everything the Team delivers. It ensures transparency and
    quality fit for the purpose of the product and organization."</i> Just as understanding what Done means on a story
    by story basis, understanding what quality means for your project and your users frames the approach your team needs
    to take to achieve it.</p>

<p>So for the last part of this conversation on quality, synthesize your team's findings and add it to your Definition
    of Done. Make that vision for quality part of how you implement the product and part of your quality control checks:
    what do you build and how will you check it. Use it to guide which activities your team will employ to assure the
    quality of the product being produced. Allow it to help your team eliminate waste and avoid rework. And bringing us
    full circle to the first play, keep it visible and revisit it as necessary to achieve a healthy dialog.</p>

<hr>
<BR><BR>
<p>Now that your team has formed a deliberate vision of quality, you all can go forward with confidence in owning the
    execution of that vision. Empower the team to collaborate with users, facilitate feedback, understand problems,
    brainstorm solutions, implement, and iterate. If you do, you will truly spark a quality revolution on your team.</p>

<p>
    <sup>1</sup> Why talk about quality? It is my goal to build great things and empower teams to build great things.
    The practices of quality assurance on our software teams today seems to have lost sight of that goal. Thus, the hope
    is to redirect those efforts to instead align towards really understanding what it means to ask, <i>"Are we building
    a high quality product?"</i>
</p>
<p>
    <sup>2</sup> Apply these concepts and host your own conversation. Let us know how it goes and I would love to see
    you at <a href="https://connectaha.com/">our talk, Something's Rotten in the State of Quality, at Connectaha</a> on
    March 8, 2019.
</p>
<p>
    <sup>3</sup> Thank you to Andy Harms for pointing out that the definition of dialog that Peter Senge uses in <i>The
    Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization</i> is most appropriate for this article.
    Dialogue def. <i>"free and creative exploration of complex and subtle issues, a deep listening to one another and
    suspending of one's own views."</i>
