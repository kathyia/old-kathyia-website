<h1>About Me & Contact</h1>
<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
    Kathy serves as a Scrum Master at Hudl. There, she has the honor of working with talented teams and individuals
    supporting the "business" side of the Hudl's efforts to market, sell, support, and report on the company's products
    and services. (<a href="https://www.hudl.com/">Hudl</a> provides video review and performance analysis tools for
    coaches and athletes to review game footage and improve team play.)</p>
<p>
    Kathy took an uncommon route to the software world, from running a nonprofit to seeing how startups fit into the
    landscape of economic development to grasping the magic of product development. Since then, she has worked on a host
    of different software projects and engineering teams. On one of her early projects, she ramped up on scrum and agile
    and fell in love with the idea that there really are ways to do work <i>well</i>.</p>
<p>
    Today you'll find her speaking at conferences and participating in the agile & product development communities.
